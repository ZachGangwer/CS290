				<h2>Assignment 0: Start to Finish</h2>
				<h3>September 21st</h3>
				<p>
					For this assignment, I opened up my editor of choice, Githubs Atom Editor. I had installed an HTML plugin for a Javascript class I took last term at LBCC, emmet, which generates a skeleton HTML page with some of the more forgetable tags, which for me is usually the entries for the head tag. From there its was pretty simple to step throught the assignment and add the nessisary entries.
