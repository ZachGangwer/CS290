						<h3>Assignment 0: Start to Finish</h23>
							<h4>September 21st</h4>
							<p>
								For this assignment, I opened up my editor of choice, Githubs Atom Editor. I had installed an HTML plugin for a Javascript class I took last term at LBCC, emmet, which generates a skeleton HTML page with some of the more forgetable tags, which for me is usually the entries for the head tag. From there its was pretty simple to step throught the assignment and add the nessisary entries.

							<h3>Assingment 1: Styling</h3>
							<h4>October 7th</h4>
							<p>
								I now have an appreciation for CSS. Before this assignment, my knowledge of CSS was very basic, I avoided it when possible, and only had used it for basic layout and color adjustments. I had the MDN CSS reference guide open the whole time I worked on this assignment, and spent a lot of time making micro adjustments. One of the most aggravating bugs I had, was due to a 1px overflow on my navbar. The margins on my a tags in the nav section were hanging over the bounds of my navbar, causing my first row of sticky notes to be indented on both ends. I spent more time then I am comfortable admitting debugging those links.
							</p>

							<h3>Assignment 2: Learning Web Debugging</h3>
							<h4>October 24th</h4>
							<p>
								With the third assignment in this class, I spent most of my time in the developer console. When I have used javascript in the past, the websites have been much simpler, only performing one task. In this assignment, I made the rookie mistake of writing what I thought would complete the entire assignment in one sitting, and then going and testing. I have been down this road before, and I should have known where it lead. I ended up spending 3x more time on debugging then I should have, and that interrupted my workflow, making me less efficient.

							<h3>Assignment 3: Noding it Up</h3>
							<h4>November 9th</h4>
							<p>
								This assignment was one of the simpler ones. Once you learn the basics of routing, I just created a switch statement to do the traffic directing. The switch statement was just a list of the possible requests and their desired destinations. Got it done in record time for this class.
							</p>
						</li>

							<h3>Assignment 4: Expressive</h3>
							<h4>November 28th</h4>
							<p>
								After the previous assignment, I learned to respect what Express does. Being able to simply tell express where to look for every request, and then have a 404 page thats for everything else requested is so much easier. With the scope of this assignment, replicating my design of the simple server from the previous assignment would have taken forever and been much harder to maintain. If I had wanted to rename a file, or add a new page, I would have to add 5 more lines of code per addition. Serving the contents of the public folder is a much more scalable approach and I will definitly be using it for my final project.
