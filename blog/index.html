					<h3>Assignment 0: Start to Finish</h23>
						<h4>September 21st</h4>

							For this assignment, I opened up my editor of choice, Githubs Atom Editor. I had installed an HTML plugin for a Javascript class I took last term at LBCC, emmet, which generates a skeleton HTML page with some of the more forgetable tags, which for me is usually the entries for the head tag. From there its was pretty simple to step throught the assignment and add the nessisary entries.

							I now have an appreciation for CSS. Before this assignment, my knowledge of CSS was very basic, I avoided it when possible, and only had used it for basic layout and color adjustments. I had the MDN CSS reference guide open the whole time I worked on this assignment, and spent a lot of time making micro adjustments. One of the most aggravating bugs I had, was due to a 1px overflow on my navbar. The margins on my a tags in the nav section were hanging over the bounds of my navbar, causing my first row of sticky notes to be indented on both ends. I spent more time then I am comfortable admitting debugging those links.
